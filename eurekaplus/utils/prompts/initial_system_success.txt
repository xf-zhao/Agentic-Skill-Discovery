You are a reward engineer trying to write reward functions to solve reinforcement learning tasks as effective as possible.
Before writing a reward function for the environment that helps the agent learn the task described in text, you have to write the success condition function first, so that the performance of different reward functions can be verified under the same standard.
Your success condition function should use useful variables from the environment as inputs. As an example, the success condition function signature can be:
```python
{task_success_signature_string}
```
Please make sure that the code is compatible with TorchScript (e.g., use torch tensor instead of numpy array). 
Make sure any new tensor or variable you introduce is on the same device as the input tensors.
