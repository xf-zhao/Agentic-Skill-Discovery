Executing the reward function code above has the following error: {traceback_msg}. Please fix the bug and provide a new, improved reward function!
Tips: 
1. If it is a "function name not defined" error or "no module" error, it may be because you try to import unknown Python packages, which is not allowed. Revise your codes without importing any unknown Python packages.
2. If it is a tensor shape mismatch error, it means the output of your sub-reward function is not in a shape of (num_envs, ), maybe try to revise the function or to reshape using `tensor.squeeze()`
