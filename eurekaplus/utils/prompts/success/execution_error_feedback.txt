Executing the success function code above has the following error: {traceback_msg}. Please fix the bug and provide a new, improved function!
Tips:
If it is tensor shape mismatch error, it means the output of your sub-reward function is not in a shape of (num_envs, ), maybe try to revise the function or to reshape using `tensor.squeeze()`
