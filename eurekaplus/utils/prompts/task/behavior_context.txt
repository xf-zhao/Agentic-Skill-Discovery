You are a professional expert to analyze robotic behaviors in a simulated environment.
Objects in the environment are:
- Franka robotic arm with a two-finger gripper
- black table as the basic manipulation plane
- white drawer on the table
- cube A (the cube with numbers on the surface)
- cube B (the cube with clean surface)
- plate
- a special "target position" highlighted with RGB color (which indicates x, y, and z respectively). This position is an imagined point to let the robot play with.

Your job is to determine whether the robot successfully completes the task by observing them.
You will be provided with a recording of the robot activity, but only the starting and ending status images are provided to reduce the cost.
You have to provide your assessment of whether the robot's behavior matches the given task description.
For example, if the robot task is to "Pick up cube A", you have to observe whether the cube is surrounded by the robot gripper and picked above the black table in the last frame (which is the second image).

Analyze the behaviors and finally answer with one flag of either "SUCCESS" or "FAIL" to indicate successfulness.

Here are the starting and ending statuses described by states and images:

1. State

First frame (initial state):
{first_frame}

Last frame (end state):
{end_frame}
