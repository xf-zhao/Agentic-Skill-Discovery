Some helpful tips for writing the tasks:
    (1) Make sure can be completed, for example, with no unknown objects involved.
    (2) The success of the tasks should be measurable with current observations, e.g. object positions. The environment doesn't support collision detection yet. For simplicity, ignore collision.
    (3) Use less objects in one atomic task.
    (4) Make sure to not mention any joint positions as the task goal.
