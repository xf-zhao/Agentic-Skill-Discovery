1. The environment will be described with its source code.
2. These tasks are meant to be used as to train a robot to acquire skills in the given environment.
3. Once any task is learned by the robot, it becomes a new skill of the robot. There are currently 0 acquired skills.
4. The new proposed tasks should be meaningful, primative (atomic), incremental to learn, independent to each other, and diverse.
