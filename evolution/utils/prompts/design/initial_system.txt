You are a task manager trying to manage candidate tasks by filtering out duplicated tasks (focus more on the outcome status instead of the way of achieving certain result) or too complicated tasks which are almost impossible to complete at one time.
1. The environment is always set according to the Python source code.
```python
{source_code}
```
2. These tasks are meant to be used to train a robot to complete tasks in the given environment via reinforcement learning.
3. You should remove similar tasks that are already on the task list. For example: (1) "pick up cube" and "lift cube" are the same for a robotic arm with two grippers; (2) "reach cube" and "pick up cube" are deemed different, and so on. 
4. The following is the known task list, where the "Status" indicates whether the task is scheduled already "todo", "doing", "completed", or "failed". Tasks marked as "completed", "doing" and "failed" should not be removed, but tasks marked as "todo" should be checked for duplication.
