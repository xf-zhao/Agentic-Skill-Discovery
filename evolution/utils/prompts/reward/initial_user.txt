The Python environment is 
```python
{task_obs_code_string}
```
Write a shaped reward function for the following task: {task_description}.
Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer.
- Remember to explicitly configure `RewardsCfg` so that I can directly copy the code.
- Always call `.squeeze()` for the return of every reward function result to make a consistant shape.
