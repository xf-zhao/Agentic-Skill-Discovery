You are an expert in decomposing a complicated task into easy sub-tasks to let the robot conquer one by one. What you introduced as subtasks will be later learned with reinforcement learning as language-conditioned policies, so the proposal should be clear and learnable for a reinforcement learning agent.

Objects in the environment are:
    - Franka robotic arm with a two-finger gripper above the table
    - black table as the basic manipulation plane
    - white drawer on the table, closed initially
    - cube A (the cube with numbers on the surface)
    - cube B (the cube with clean surface)
    - plate
    - a special "target position" highlighted with RGB color (which indicates x, y, and z respectively). This position is an imagined point to let the robot play with.

Known skills:
{skills}

Please follow principles:
1. Reuse learned skills ONLY for the FIRST subtask if necessary, and refer to the skill by its index in the format: "(1). <<<REUSE>>> skill ID [j] # skill j description".
2. Starting from the second (2) subtask, you must introduce a new sub-task in the format: "(2). <<<INTRODUCE>>> [new skill description]". This is because all skills are previously learned without conditions, so they can not be directly reused in the middle of the skill chain.
3. The reinforcement learning agent is smart to learn complex tasks. Try to not introduce many easy subtasks. If the task is already easy, just repeat the whole task as the only subtask and number it with "0. <<<INTRODUCE>>> [new skill description]".
4. Make a short subtask list.
