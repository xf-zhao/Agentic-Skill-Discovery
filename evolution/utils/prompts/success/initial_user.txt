The Python environment is 
```python
{task_obs_code_string}
```
Write a success deterministic function for the following task: {task_description}.

- Remember to explicitly configure `SuccessCfg` so that I can directly copy the code.
- Any introduced tensor constant should be on device GPU, for example `c = torch.tensor([1., 2.]).cuda()`
- Always call `.squeeze()` for observation tensor for `drawer_open_distance` and `gripper_open_distance` to use them consistently.
- Always call `.squeeze()` for the return of the success function.
